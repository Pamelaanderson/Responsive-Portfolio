                            <p> I'm Pamela. I just moved to the Atlanta area in May along with my husband and our
                                daughter. I've worked
                                alot in the marketing and sales side of the industry but ready to take on the
                                challenging side of being
                                a developer. </p><br>
                            <p>I was born and raised in Arkansas and that's still where my heart lies.
                                Hogs fan all they way (even though they might be having a off year). <br></p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Other than sports I enjoy taking random trips with my daughter. We like to search
                                around for random things to go to and we go.
                            </p>
